# Handoff preview

When you trigger a handoff from an AI agent conversation in a Dev or Stage environment to Desk, the system displays a preview instead of creating an actual ticket. This preview shows the ticket information that would be sent to Desk based on your configured Desk rules.

{% hint style="info" %}
To configure Desk rules, go to Settings > Desk > Rules on Sendbird Dashboard.
{% endhint %}

## When to use

Use Handoff preview to:

* Test and validate your Desk rules configuration during the handoff flow
* Debug handoff issues without creating real tickets
