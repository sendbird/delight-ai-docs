# Handoff preview

In the Development or Staging environment, all features, including the Handoff function, can be tested. We provide a preview mode when you trigger the Handoff to Desk in non-Production environments, allowing you to verify ticket details according to the Desk rules you have set.

{% hint style="info" %}
Go to Settings > Rules and check the Desk rules.
{% endhint %}
