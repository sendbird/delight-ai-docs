# Knowledge

Knowledge is the foundation of the AI agent's responses. Securing this critical asset requires careful attention to data ingestion, classification, and lifecycle management.

### Data ingestion

Delight AI allows you to ingest knowledge from a variety of content sources, including:

* Manually uploaded files
* Snippets
* Websites
* Integrations with third-party platforms such as Salesforce and Confluence

Integrations are particularly important because they enable AI agents to access existing company data, which may include highly sensitive information.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All credentials and API keys used for integrations must be treated as sensitive assets and handled securely.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information, refer to the [Integrations](../../dashboard-guide/integrations/) guide.
{% endhint %}

### Monitoring and Data classification

Analyze ingesting data and perform a classification process to determine whether it contains content that should be used in the responses from the AI agent
