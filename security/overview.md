This guide provides security considerations and best practices for Delight AI agent platform. Security is a shared responsibility between our customers and Sendbird. While Sendbird delivers core security features and controls, customers must configure and operate them effectively to meet their specific security and compliance requirements.

This guide has six sections:

### 1. Organization & Account

This section provides guidance on securing your Sendbird organization and user accounts. It covers critical measures such as enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) aligned with the Principle of Least Privilege, enforcing Single Sign-On (SSO), and applying strong access control policies to safeguard administrative and user access.

### 2. Workspace & Agent level instructions

This section explains how to configure instructions that guide AI Agent behavior and how to manage them securely. It covers both Agent-level and Workspace-level instructions, highlighting best practices that prevent the inclusion of sensitive information. Additionally, it introduces Sendbird’s safeguard features, which protect against misuse and ensure that AI responses remain safe and reliable.
