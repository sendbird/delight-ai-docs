The Delight AI Agent SDK for iOS provides the foundation for enabling your AI agent to interact with users in your app. Through the in-app [Messenger](../../../dashboard-guide/build/channels/messenger/) channel, users can submit their reports and inquiries using various message types. The guides in **Features** explain how to use the SDK—from customizing the launcher’s look and feel to controlling navigation flows and supported message formats.
